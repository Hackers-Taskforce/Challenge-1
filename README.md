# Hackers Taskforce: Ethical Hacking Basics

Welcome to the **Hackers Taskforce: Ethical Hacking Basics** script! This tool will guide you through some basic ethical hacking steps to help you get started with penetration testing and security analysis. The script walks you through setting up essential tools like **Nmap** and **Metasploit**, and introduces you to network reconnaissance, vulnerability scanning, and decoding hidden messages.

## Challenge Overview

This script is designed for beginners in the field of ethical hacking. Your mission is to follow the steps outlined in the script and uncover a hidden secret message. Here’s what you’ll be doing:

1. **Installing Nmap**: You'll learn how to install and run Nmap, a powerful network scanner, to explore a target IP address.
2. **Running Nmap**: The script guides you through using Nmap to scan open ports and gather information about a target system.
3. **Learning Network Reconnaissance**: Understand the basics of reconnaissance and how to interpret Nmap scan results.
4. **Installing Metasploit** (Optional): For those who want to explore further, you'll be introduced to Metasploit, a popular penetration testing framework.
5. **Decoding the Secret Message**: The script includes a hidden base64-encoded message. Your job is to decode it using your skills.
   
The hidden message in this script is encoded using base64. The challenge is to find and decode it. The script will provide hints along the way, and the decoded message will give you a deeper insight into the purpose of this script.

## Requirements

- **Kali Linux** or a compatible Linux-based environment
- **Python 3.x**
- **Nmap** (installed via the script)
- **Metasploit Framework** (optional)

## Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Hackers-Taskforce/HackerCMD.git
    cd HackerCMD
    ```

2. **Run the Script**:
    ```bash
    python hackercmd.py
    ```

3. **Follow the Instructions**: The script will walk you through each step of the process, guiding you to install necessary tools and perform network scanning.

4. **Decode the Hidden Message**: 
    - Inside the script, there’s a base64-encoded string.
    - The script gives you the hint to find it and decode it using your tools or your own decoding techniques.
    - Once decoded, the message will give you a new piece of information for the next steps.

5. **Final Reminder**:
    - Always use your hacking skills responsibly and with permission. Unauthorized access or attacks on networks or systems is illegal and unethical.
    - Continue learning and exploring the world of ethical hacking.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this challenge, you will:
- Learn basic network scanning techniques with **Nmap**.
- Understand how to use **Metasploit** for penetration testing.
- Practice decoding base64-encoded messages.
- Gain an appreciation for ethical hacking practices and responsible usage.
